Contributing to x3d2
====================

Fixed a bug?  Have an idea for improving x3d2? x3d2 is developed in
the open with a license that allows anyone to

- Run the program as they wish, for any purpose.
- Access and study its source code, and making changes to it.
- Redistribute copies (source or binary).
- Distribute copies of your modified versions (source or binary).

Particularly, we encourage you to contribute your changes back to the
x3d2 project. The following sections described the process for doing
so.

If you are looking to take part in the project, several options are available

- Report (a) bug(s), suggest improvement(s) or share a user experience.
- Work on the documentation.
- Work on fixing bugs or implementing new features.

In any of the cases above, your entry point should be the `issue
tracker <https://github.com/xcompact3d/x3d2/issues>`_ -- either to
pick an existing issue to work on or to create a new one.
